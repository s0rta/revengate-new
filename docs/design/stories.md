## The Audition
The blade was moving dangerously fast around the young man's Adam's apple. He was fighting hard to suppress his urge to swallow.

*Psssscht!*

The loud hissing came every minute or so but it didn't seem to have any effect on the swift strokes of the barber's blade.

"How's the job hunting?" the barber asked.

"Not good, Michel," the young man on the chair replied. "No one is hiring architects anymore. It's like they aren't making building anymore. All they are looking for are sailors and engineers, probably to build more of those dragons like they have next door."

"That fierce beast is a rotopress," Michel replied. "Instead of going up and down, it goes round and round. It prints pages by rolling the types over them. It's quite the sight."

Michel worked in silence for a several minutes, then he switched to a smaller blade for the delicate short strokes under the young man's nose.

"Have you tried growing a mustache?" Michel asked. "I can shape it for you and it would make you look more experienced." Michel stepped back to consider his work. "But it might also give thieves the impression that you've been successful in life. Did you say you can fight?"

"Don't worry about that, Michel. My father saw that I learned how to defend myself." There was not point in hiding the truth. "He was a very assertive man and more often than not, it's him that I had to wrestle down." 

Michel the barber removed the remnants of shaving soap with a wet towel, then rubbed some fragrant lotion between his hands. The young man braces for the sting, but he was sank back down in the chair when a blanket of comfort enveloped his face.

"This smells good!" The young man exclaimed. "Quite exotic!"

"This is sandal wood. Traders from Morocco have it at the market from time to time, but the only reliable supply is with the smugglers" Michel passed the young man a large mirror, almost 10cm across. "You'd probably get lost down there. They say those dark passages are as twisty as Pinot vines."

The barber was obviously referring to the network of corridors built under Lyon over the years by the silk workers.

"The traboules?" the young man replied. "I've seen many plans in school. I don't think they are the maze that people claim they are. They mostly run East-West and their is a method to their madness. Structural walls for example are very obvious. Those never twist." 

A faint smile slowly grew under the barber's perfectly curved mustache. 

"Today's shave is on the house, young man, to help you settle in your new life. Now please do me a favour and exit from the back. You'll find the door on the other side of that broom closet. If you bump into my friend Nadège on the way out, tell her that I sent you and that you are looking for work."

Puzzled, the young man followed the barber's directions. The closet door lead to a long hallway, which in turn lead to an orate green door. Beyond the door was a café with less than a dozen guests. No one seemed to pay attention to the young man when he sat at the bar.


## The Initiation

There were a dozen students sitting around the table, all bent over large leather bound books. They were all in their early twenties and judging by their attires, they came from all walks of life.

An older man entered the room. "Neophytes," he called, "Brother de Lévi is here for your aptitude test."

Brother de Lévi followed. We was in his early forties and was wearing a dark robe. On his shoulder was a leather satchel and in his hand was a long cane with an intricate large pommel. He placed both on the table before taking a seat. The older man who had introduced him retreated to a corner of the room.

De Lévi studied the room while the students exchanged excited glances and closed their books. 

"I would like you to close your eyes," de Lévi called, "and thing back to the brightest fire you've ever seen. For some of you, it is going to be a bonfire at the solstice festival, some of you will think of the coal box on a great steam engine, and maybe a lucky few fill remember the roaring furnace of a steal foundry."

De Lévi retrieved a notebook, a fountain pen, and a glass rod from his satchel.

"Remember the color of the fire," he continued, "remember the smell, and its heat on your face. Bring the fire in front of you and hold it between your hands."

Without opening their eyes, the students slowly moved their arms. Some held their arms wide apart, some had their hand cupped in a tight ball, and there was everything in between.

"Breath deeper now," de Lévi called, "and fan those flames. Make them grow brighter... hotter... stronger..."

The faces of the students came alive with their effort. Some brows became wrinkly from being pushed together, some mouths frowned while some opened to eased a laboured breathing. De Lévi scribbled some notes.

"Brighter... hotter... stronger..." he reminded them.

The only sounds in the room were deep breathing and a faint ticking that came from de Lévi's cane. It was not as fast as the ticking of a pocked watch and not as slow as that of a pendulum clock, about halfway in between. A trained ear could have recognized the distinctive two-tone clicking of a lever escapement, but that detail was missed since everyone in the room had their attention somewhere else.

"Brighter... hotter... stronger... Bring the flames right here in front of you." 

De Lévi took his glass rod and stood up. He walked next to a student and placed the bulbous end of the rod between the students hands. He held it there for a moment.

"Brighter... hotter... stronger..." 

He moved around the table, repeating the process and gently separating the hands that were help too close together. When he was done, he went back to his seat.

"You can relax now," de Lévi told them, "but before you open your eyes, you must quench your fire. You can make it starve or drown it in water. It's all up to you."

He jotted some more notes while the students opened their eyes one by one. They exchanged puzzled looks and smiles in silence while de Lévi was scribbling.

"I'm going to recommend four of you for the study of channeling." He told them. "The rest of you will get to decide between potions making, ancient languages, and the crafting of arcane devices. Sister, what is your name?" He pointed his pen at one student who immediately started blushing.

"Jeanne." She responded.

"Jeanne," de Lévi continued, "you have a boiler inside of you that has more steam than five train engines together. I will be mentoring you personally once a month." He closed his notebook and caped his pen. "That is all for me today and I hope to see you all at the next full moon ritual."

"Brother de Lévi," a student sheepishly called. "We were told that you might give us a demonstration."

De Lévi turned around towards the older man in the corner of the room who met his gaze with a nod and a smile.

"I see." De Lévi tucked his belongings back into his satchel and grabbed his cane while he rose. "Channeling is entirely possible with the mind alone," he explained, "but we now know that it is also greatly facilitated by the use of the appropriate device."

He rotated a disc at the base of the pommel of his cane. Everyone could plainly see through the elegant cuts in the pommel that something colorful was moving inside. He closed his eyes and lifted the cane high above his head.

They immediately felt the chill.

It took no time for their breath to start fogging up. It was more than just a feeling, the whole room was now as cold as a winter night. The students exchanged looks of surprise and euphoria as they started to shiver.

With his eyes still closed, de Lévi slowly brought down his cane. When its base touched the floor, the wind started. It was a gentle breeze at first, but it grew stronger with every rising and falling of de Lévi's chest. Soon enough, pages and light objects were flying across the room and the students were crouching to avoid them.

De Lévi lifted his cane then it all stopped.

He opened his eyes and started rotating the disc at the base of the pommel. 

"Brother de Lévi," a student called, "that was most eloquent. Will we learn this spell?"

"Yes," de Lévi replied with a smile. "If you study study hard, ten years from now you will master this little party trick and a whole lot more. If you study hard."

De Lévi grabbed his satchel and gave a modest bow.

"That is all for me today and I hope to see you all at the next full moon ritual. Welcome to the Blue Circle Lodge!"


## What Lurks in the Crypt

Baw pushed her rapier forward as she crawled through the narrow passage. She clenched her jaw every time she heard the scrapping sound. An hour with a whetstone and she would be able to restore the blade's edge, but the ornate hilt guard would need professional attention, the kind of attention that would core her some pretty Francs if she had any hope of wearing her blade in public again without making a fool of herself. 

Baw was a field agent for Lux Co. She generally liked her job. She liked the fencing and she liked the spying. "Bordel," she muttered as she freed one shoulder from a tight squeeze. She didn't like narrow passages, she didn't like rats, and she really hated narrow passages full of rats. But now that she thought about it, it had been a while since the last encountered a rat. This might have been a good or a bad thing and something in the back of her mind told her that answering this particular questions could tell her a lot about herself and about where she was.

The needs of the moment forced her to dismiss those reflections aside as purely academic. Her carbide lamp was flickering vigorously. The bright naked white flame had been perfectly steady until now and she wasn't sure which of the three brass knobs she was supposed to adjust. Was she was simply running out of fuel? A metal grate was coming in sight and with a bit of luck, it would force her to turn around and to start making way towards a warm bath.

The grate offered no resistance. She was obviously not the first one to use this route to enter the church compound and the previous intruder had been discreet enough that priests saw to need to commission repairs to the mortar.

The narrow passage opened into a low vaulted room with three layer of alcoves covering two of the walls. Baw had reached the crypt.

She carefully replaced the grate and did  her best to dust herself away from the entry point. She was after incriminating documents. She knew that those were more likely to be found in the offices above, but she was here all alone and it seemed like a good place to start searching. 

Most of the alcoves hosted stone caskets, but a few has rows of urns separated by ornate wooden boxes here and there. She found many golden crosses and jeweled chalices, but nothing resembling documents. After the fourth box, She decided to move on.

Shadows danced as she moved across the room. The lamp was a constant flicker now. One of the shadows passed right in front of her then brushed against her neck. She felt the cold sting and immediately took a step back. It was like a frostbite from a strong blizzard reaching deep below her skin. 

The shadow seemed to absorb more of the light, to grow darker. It had the vague outline of a person and it was floating slowly towards Baw. She drew her rapier and slashed. The blade went right through the dark form. She slashed again. 

As the blade passed through the shadows, the shaped reached for Baw's hand. The chill was so sharp that she dropped her weapon. The ringing of hardened steel echoed through the silent hallways ahead. 

For several seconds, she could neither feel nor move her fingers. She took several steps back. When the sensation painfully came back, her fingers felt like old rusty cogs struggling to move.

"A ghost?" She wondered out loud. She reached for her breast pocket and pulled a straight razor. The mother-of-pearl handle was expertly crafted, the polished blade reflected light on the walls. Her next stroke was swift with her whole body extended to avoid exposing herself to the dark shape. The form twisted as the blade passed through. She could not tell how much she had hurt it, but at least this blade was doing something.

Three more slashed and she had pushed the shape back about half a meter. This would take a while. She heard faint steps coming from somewhere deep inside the hallway. *So much for a sneaky entrance*, she thought.

She kept slashing as the sound of footsteps grew closer, then suddenly the dark shape slid away from her and merged with one of the walls. She raced to retrieve her rapier the darted down the hallway ready to face whoever was coming. The flame from her carbide lamp was now dim, yellow, and sooty.

She almost tripped when her legs froze after she got close enough to see that it was not a person coming. The four legged creature was as large as a pony. It the body of a griffin with a human head perched atop a long neck. Wings were folded along its back. The creature turned its head, revealing another face, that of a large cat. It roared. The sound sent shivers down Baw's spine, it was deep and metallic, like nothing she had heard before. 

Baw spun around and ran to the closest side room, placed the carbide lamp on the ground, then sheathed her rapier. The clicking of claws on the stone floor were steadily drawing closer, unhurriedly. Baw assessed her surroundings. The room was just like the first one she had been in. It was not very big, but it would have to do.

The creature entered the room. Baw could now see another face on the side of the head opposite to the cats face. It had a long dog-like snout with pointy teeth. The human face was very beautiful with fine angular features. It could have been the face of a woman or that of a man still too young to grow a mustache. The beastly torso was very muscular. 

The creature kept approaching and Baw snapped out of her contemplation. Now was the time.

She sprinted towards the creature. When she was two meters away, she dove sideways and rolled with the landing. A set of claws dug into her shoulder as she moved passed the monster.

The pain came instantly, a here and now kind of pain. It was the king of paint that makes one forget about what year it is and what kind of hat they were hoping to buy with the next week's wages. In Baw's mind, there room for only two things: the source of the pain behind and the dark hallway ahead. She raced into the darkness. 

She ran as fast as she could with eyes wide open even though there was nothing to see. She ran with he hand brushing the wall. She ran and tripped and fell, then got back up and ran again. She ran and fell again when she reached the stairs, then clumsily made her way up until she bumped into a wooden door with a loud thump.

Baw collapsed on the ground after passing the door. The penumbra gave just enough light to see the outline of her surroundings: a long hallways with moonlight coming from somewhere around the corner. After her breath slowed down, she pressed her ear against the wooden door. The only sound came from her still racing heart. If the creature was still chasing her, it must have been far behind. 

It all came back slowly after that: she was here for documents and she liked spying. She started walking as silently as she could down the hallway. She also started recall the plans of the Church compound that she had studied before her mission. The plans had shown a wall around the perimeter of the compound. Baw had never seen the wall, but she could picture it in her mind: old and tall, aged enough to feature plenty of gaps between the stones. 

Baw would climb that wall on her way out.
