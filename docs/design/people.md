## François Ravaillac
One of the greatest assassins all time.

## Foujoi Porans
Small time criminal who aspires to become a great assassin like Ravaillac. He takes jobs from from Franconian nobles: vandalizing shops and beating up people who have attracted the hatred of the influential. Porans does not care for politic, but since most of his clients are royalists, he is likely to favour that faction if he is really pushed to make a call.

He maintains his protection racket by leading a small group of thugs. He is pretty good at fist fighting (savate style). He can use a dagger, but he is pretty much useless with longer blades. Promises of training about poisons and toxins are likely to influence him.

Porans is tall and skinny, sporting a long dark mustache and a poorly shaven face in general. He has a hawk nose and dark brown eyes. More often then not, you will see him in a blue double breasted vest, shirt sleeves rolled up, bowler hat on his head. Some knife fight scars are obvious on his left wrist.


## Le Grand Salapou
Le Grand Salapou is the manager of several circuses roaming the world. He started his career as a clown and for the most part, he still is one. He still wears makeup and goofy outfits and plays magic tricks randomly as he goes through his day.

Now in his 50's, he gained mastery in many of the circus skills though the year. Beware of his slight if hand if you ever come in close quarter with him. He will easily pick pocket you as he pretends to let you search him and he could plant a poisoned needle in your shoulder while dodging a sword strike. He is a trained actor, so abandon hope of reading him and be very weary of his persuasion skills. 

With circuses in a dozen cities at any given time, Salapou controls a substantial network of spies and smugglers. The profit from smuggling finances the underground activities of the enterprise. Salapou has a life long dedication in putting smiles on people's faces. He can't stand the chronically negative types and he is genuinely concerned about the contagious nature of their affliction. As such, Salapou's underground business often deals with the removing these incurable individuals from society.

Because he is always seen in character, very few would be able to recognize him if he was to venture out in civilian attire. He has a strong stature and is significantly overweight, probably around 250 lbs by the look of it, but some speculate that this is part of his costume. Dishevelled, mismatched clothing with a checkered jacket and a bowler hat two sizes two small is how he appears more often than not, but he is versatile with his look and has been seen is flashy – and obviously goofy – outfits when performing for influential audiences.

## Pridout Fauchève
Pridout Fauchève is a smuggler who seems able to source the most elusive goods. Nobles and scientists alike go to him to for luxury and rare materials. He controls the only supply chain of various exotic herbs used in religious and occult rituals, making him a very powerful individual a presumably a very wealthy one as well.

Fauchève has a tribal view of the world: members of his clan before anything else. He is strongly against letting addictive substances ruin youth in the name of profit. He values connections and information more than money.

He sports low key heavily worn sailor outfits. His face is animated by nervous ticks making his dark full beard dance like it's hosting a small family of squirrels. 


## Nadège Cyrat
Nadège Cyrat is the first contact the hero has with the Compagnie des Lumières. She is a field agent and a recruiter there.

She is the youngest of three siblings, daughter of a clock maker in Paris. She has been with the Compagnie since she was 19, she is now 27. She is deeply motivated to see the advancement of science and technology and for the dominance of Franconia in those fields.

Her mother died of illness when she was 14. She left to Lyon for studying when she was 18. To make ends meet, she accepted a few odd jobs with the underground, which is how she got recruited by the Compagnie.

She is very agile and skilled in many fighting styles. She is not a magic user.

She has light blue-grey eyes and light brown hair that she keeps short. She wears crinoline dresses and decorated hats in public, but she prefers more masculine attires when she is at the Compagnie's workshops. This usually means docker overalls when doing work at a bench or lighter more athletic pants when training. 

Her favourite drink is Champagne with a splash of cassis syrup, but she will readily settle for an Absinthe. She drinks several cups of coffee every day, always with cream and one sugar cube. Sitting by herself in a cafe, she is usually seen reading a book, typically about philosophy. 

When her father sent her to Lyon, it was with the goal of studying engineering, specifically, the making of programmable machines like the Jacquard loom. Ideally, she would have found an apprenticeship there after learning all the fundamentals, but she never went that far. She knows how to repair most simple looms and given enough time, she can decypher coded punch tape, but she is far from proficient in that domain. She often uses jargon and metaphores from the textile industry in her everyday speech.

Nadège is skilled in the making of small complicated gadgets, such as spying and assassin's tools.

She is patient with her craft, but less so with people. She expects fast results when she asks for something. She prefers tactical retreat over complete defeat, but the can't stand people who make excuses rather than owning their failures.

She values creativity and will readily praise it.  Nadège is very energetic and her emotions and state of mind are usually very obvious.

She is always very interested by foreign combat techniques, less so by foreign culture. She has a fascination for subtle assassination techniques, more on an academic level since she usually favors solutions that keep all involved parties alive.

How she spends her presumably generous earning from La Compagnie is a frequent topic of speculation amongst other field agents.


## Henry Bessemer
Henry Bessemer is an inventor living in Saxonia. Now 34 years old, he is very well of financially thanks to the commercial success of earlier inventions in his late twenties and early thirties. This gives him the freedom to pursue capital intensive discoveries around heavy industries.

Bessemer currently has close ties with the Saxonian military and there are reasons to suspect that he is on the verge of dramatically changing how easy it is to produce steel, with the goal of arming Saxonia with heavy war machines.

He primarily speaks English, but he knows some French thanks to his father who lived in Franconia for a while.

He has blue-gray eyes, a fast receding hairline, and bushy sideburns. Taking advantage of his wealth, he likes to appear in fancy attires in public, such as a three-piece suit with a top hat and an ornate cane. In private, he is a workaholic and will most likely be seen with a thick leather apron if he is working on prototype furnaces or with a lab coat while working in his metallurgy lab. A decorated fountain pen and a stained leather-bound notebook follow him wherever he goes.

Bessemer is an industrialist at heart. He has little interests for pure science and focuses solely on inventions with large commercial potential. Potential for his inventions have changed his allegiances in the past.

## Ambrose Hamillois
Ambrose Hamillois is a potion maker with a workshop in Lyon. The very first impression of him might be of a very dishevelled Victorian Santa Claus. He is in his mid-60s with a large grey beard and long hairs that run in all directions. He is typically seen in a three piece suit of dark colours that is of great need for a pressing. A small bow tie and a propped up collar at his neck and a well worn top hat complete his signature look.

The store front where he does business looks line a small cramped and overfilled bookstore. The back of the store is where the actual business takes place. A long work bench takes most of one wall. Then bench has scales, mortars of various sizes, and some laboratory glassware. On the wall opposed to the bench is an array of glass jars of all shapes and sizes all containing some coloured liquid.

Hamillois harvests some of the herbs and spices that go into the potions himself, mostly from the countryside near Lyon. Most of his supplies however come from a solid network of trusted merchants and smugglers. 

Hamillois is not completely anti-science, but he is distrusting of physics and engineering. He is however completely up to date on all the recent development and discoveries in the field of botany. He is slightly partial to royalists.


## Charles Beaudelaire
Charles Beaudelaire is a writer from Paris. At the time of our adventure he is 32 years old and he is not doing poetry full time yet. He writes an art review column for a living and occasionally some anti-royalist articles in his spare time.

Beaudelaire is a self-described "dandy" who likes to dress in fancy cloths. Most commonly, he is seen dressed in a three piece suit with his signature pointy-end bow tie made of fine silk. He likes a high-collar great coat to fight the cold weather. He can't grow much of a mustache and therefore goes for the clean shaven look. At 32, his hairline has already started receding. He keeps his blond hair cut short. His eyes are blue.

From previous trips to India and Morocco, Beaudelaire has kept some connections and does small time private imports of exotic goods. Notably, he is a member of the hashish society and has sponsored a few drug runs.

He is a very occasional hashish user, preferring wine on most days and shunning absinthe as well as most hard liquors. He loves to hang out in cafés, drink a lot, and then let the alcohol infused inspiration move his poetry projects forward. 


## Michel Boilou
Michel Boilou is a barber at the Steamy Towels in Lyon. He also is the doorman for some of the Lux Co. secret compounds. Notably, an out-out-sight door at the back of a broom closet in this barber lounge leads to an absinthe café.

Boilou is tall and skinny with dark hair and impeccably shaped handlebar mustache. He typically wears a vest of black satin and flamboyant silk patterns. Flowers usually decorates his shop and he is found of using botanical metaphors to describe things.

He radiates the impression of a very peaceful man, but if needs be, he can masterfully defend himself with a straight razor. He is also trained with the rapier and he maintains and uncommonly sharp edge on his discrete sword cane.

Boilou has been a field agent for Lux Co. for some years, but four years ago he decided to start a family and thereby settled for less adventurous duties. He relay messages to select individuals who pretend to visit him for grooming, but he also happens to deliver the closest shaves in town.

He is very skilled at getting unsuspecting patrons to open up about private details of their life and work, information that Boilou promptly relays to Lux Co. 

His shop is located next to a very active newspaper. The noisy steam powered printing press next door easily drowns the conversations and the occasional light music in the absinthe café. 

Boilou is now 38 with a three year old son and his wife is pregnant with another child.


## Philippe Blûmot

Philippe Blûmot is the leader of the canut underground. He is independently wealthy from operating a loop of his own and exerts considerable influence in Lyon through his role in the underground network.

He is a third generation silk worker. His father had a loom before him, but Philippe insisted in commissioning his own loom so he could run more complex punch card patterns. He is a master of the loom and can tell at a glance what pattern a stack of cards will produce. He also uses cards for secret communications with other loom masters who are able to tell if a deck would produce a nonsense weave and thereby convey some hidden meaning.

His two younger brothers, Jacques and Martin, went into trade and farming respectively, staying only tangentially connected with the family tradition. They do not want anything to do with Philippe's work with the underground. 

Philippe Blûmot is a masters of the traboules. He knows all the shortcuts, what password will open which doors, and where are the transient bases of the canut underground. 

Philippe Blûmot is an adept of the two weapon rapier and dagger fighting style, a techniques well adapted to the narrow corridors of the traboules. He has no skills with poisons himself, but there are many able assassins working for him in the canut underground.

Blûmot wears his dark brown hair short. He always sports a well groomed handlebar mustache in the classic Franconian style. More often than not, he wears a sleeveless vest of fine silk over a white shirt. His vests always feature elaborate patterns such as paisley, which are always weaved, never printed. A brightly coloured tucked-in plain silk cravat completes the outfit.

There is something mysterious about his bright blue eyes – the gaze you'd expect from a stage magician.

His drink of choice is cognac drank neat from a snifter. He also starts his days with several cups of coffee, which is drinks black with a decadent number of sugar cubes.

Blûmot's speech is courteous and sophisticated. He readily employs flattery to secure large orders from nobles, just like he praises to cement the loyalty of this staff both at the loom and with the underground.


## Pierre Dupont

Pierre Dupont is a poet and song writer from Lyon. Mélissandre Favaresse is having an affair with him. 

Dupont is the son of a blacksmith. His mother died while he was still a toddler. He spent some time in Paris where he met Baudelaire and a few other more famous poets. He wrote one revolutionary song, Le Chant des Ouvriers, something that Lux Co. is not fond of, but these days he writes mostly about romantic love.

He is 33 when our adventure starts in 502 AP.

Dupont is tall with broad shoulders. He keeps hi dark brown hair long and boasts a well trimmed full beard of the same colour.  His light brown eyes are full of fire and passion. He sings in local pubs and will occasionally burst into signing while sitting in  a café, which would be a disturbing behaving from most people, but since Dupont in  endowed with a rich and beautiful voice, his songs are always welcome. It's during one of those impromptu songs that he met Mélissandre.


## Édouard de Lévi

Édouard de Lévi is a mage and a Grand Master of the Blue Circle lodge. He is 52 at the start of our adventure and lives in Montpelier.

He studied to become a Benedict monk, but fell in love with a woman and left the order before taking the vows. During his studies, he proved to be a voracious reader and managed to get his hands on a few occult manuals tucked away in a dark corner of the abbey. He immediately showed affinity for the material, but without proper teaching, he would have to wait before he could unlock any of the most significant spells.

He got initiated to the Blue Circle Lodge in Germany. He quickly climbed the ranks, reaching "master" after only eight years. That's when he came back to establish the Franconian chapter of the secret society.

De Lévi aspires to restore magic at the core of human society.  He sees magic as compatible with religion and hopes to see monks reuniting with the ancient art to have a bigger impact on their communities. He also feels like too much credit is given to science and hopes to take away some of the hero glamour from the researchers. At the same time, he feels like magic is too powerful for the masses and he wants to keep it's teaching secret and well controlled.
