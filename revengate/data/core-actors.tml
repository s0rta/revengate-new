The giant locust are usually found in groups of 6 to 120 individuals. They eat some plants, but usually prefer to hunt small animals.

Pacherrs come from nomadic tribes in Ukraine and Eastern Russian. They form strong bonds within their clan and will readily help any individual within the clan. Clans have a matriarchal structure with an elder female having the final word on internal affairs.
