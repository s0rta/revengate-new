New quest: Bewitching Bookkeeping
Minor quest failures are no longer game-over conditions; you can continue, but you don't get any quest rewards.

Bugfixes:
- accented characters now use the same font as regular text

Combat:
- new monsters: automaton and yarohu
- new weapons: cane and weighted cane

UX:
- new quick attack button (bottom right)
- it's now easier to cancel a multi-turn travel command
- dragging the map follows your finger at all zoom level
