- Who is that?
	Michel: She hangs at the Café Caché. Take the secret door in my broom closet on the left and go talk to her.

Michel: I have too many potions and they use some valuable shelve space. Would you like one?
- Sure!

	Michel: There you go!
- No, thank you.
	do checkpoint("dungeon_intro")
	Michel: That's a bold choice!

Michel: You can pinch to zoom in or out and drag the screen to get a better view of what is going on. This also works while you are traveling.

Michel: Monsters are represented by letters. You beat them up by tapping on them. You look like a tough person, but you are not invincible. Keep an eye on your Health at the top right. 

Michel: You can get more info about monsters by using the magnifying glass (🔍, top right). You can also use it on yourself. Items are white icons scattered through the areas. You need to be standing over them to loot (pick) them.

Michel: Try a long tap (hold your finger down for a bit) at different locations. You will see action option based on what is there.

Michel: If a button has [b]bold[/b] text, it means that what it does counts as your action for the turn. Right after pressing it, your turn ends and monsters will start acting. There are a few obvious exceptions and I'm sure you will figure them out.

Michel: Good luck!
