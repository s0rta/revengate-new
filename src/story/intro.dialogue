	Michel: I brought too many potions and they are getting annoyingly heavy. Would you like one?
	- Sure!

~ dungeon_intro

Michel: Monsters are represented by letters. You beat them up by tapping on then. You look like a tough person, but you are not invincible. Keep an eye on your Health at the bottom right. 

Michel: You can get more info about monsters by using the magnifying glass (üîç, top right). You can also use it on yourself. Items are white icons scattered throught the dungeon. You need to be standing over them to loot (pick) them.

Michel:  Try a long tap (hold your finger down for a bit) at different locations. You will see action option based on what is there.

Michel: Good luck!
