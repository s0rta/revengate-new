~ meet_michel

Michel: Hi! I'm Michel. I run the Steamy Towels barbershop near the port. Drop by for a shave sometime.

~ dungeon_intro

Michel: Monsters are represented by letters. You beat them up by tapping on then. You look like a tough person, but you are not invincible. Keep an eye on your Health at the bottom right. 

Michel: You can get more info about monsters by using the magnifying glass (🔍, top right). You can also use it on yourself. Items are white icons scattered throught the dungeon. You need to be standing over them to loot (pick) them.

Michel: Good luck!

=> END

~ extra_potions

Michel: I brought too many potions and they are getting annoyingly heavy. Would you like one?
- Sure!
- No, thank you.

Michel: OK. I'll be right here. Chat with me again if you want to learn more about the dungeon.
