~ intro
% Local: I don't know why barbers rush so much. I've got to tell you, I kind of get scared seing that blade moving so fast around my throat. Thankfully, it's not a rusty old dull blade. Have you noticed that razors in Lyon are never rusty?
% Local: My friend went to a sÃ©ance the other day and they are sure they heard voices from the dead. I think it's a load of rubbish, when you're dead, you're dead.
% Local: Have you heard that the Salapou Circus is in town? I saw them whem I was 12, I can't believe they are still around!
% Local: I don't like how much it rains around here during the winter. The traboules are shielded from the rain, but I'd rather carry an umbrella. Those passages are just too dark and confusing. 
% Local: I love the taste of sewer alligator eggs, but if I had the kind of money to splurge like that regularly, I would probably go for wine instead.
% Local: I'm not sure how deep the sewers are, but if you start smelling them, you are probably not safe anymore.
