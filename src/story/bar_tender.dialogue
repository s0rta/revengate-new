~ about_lyon
Simon: Hills are very steep in Lyon, which is why most of our streets run parallel to the rivers. The best way to get around on foot is to know which door hides a traboule. 

Simon: Traboules are dark an twisty, but they usually get you where you want to go faster than a horse carriage.

Simon: Take a look at the map (ðŸ—º) at the top right once you get back to the surface to see where the traboule took you.
