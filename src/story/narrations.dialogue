Narrator: As you step foot outside of the staircase, you notice that the air is more humid here. The occasional black spots on the walls are most certainly mold, which would explain the smell. \n\nWhatever is making noise in the distance does not sound friendly at all. \n\nYou recall the advice given to you by your mentor years ago: "if your blade does not seem to slice through, it's probably time to use something heavier or more pointy." \n\nThe room has a old feel to it, like the walls are leaning in slightly. It must have been built before many of the advanced of modern archticture. \n\nThe stones on the floor have some polish to them. People have been travelling this path for some time. \n\nWhat about that pile of debris in the corner? Could those be bones? \n\nYou are getting nervous about what lies ahead.
