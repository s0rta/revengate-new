Nadège: So you are the new guy? I have a job for you.
Nadège: A stack of loom punch cards (𝌕) was stolen a few days ago and we have a lead on where the thieves are hiding. It's a gated neighborhood a few blocks Northwest of here, there is a discrete way in with the traboule around the corner.
Nadège: Take this, just in case you need to defend yourself.

Nadège: Don't forget to equip it in the Inventory screen or you might take a beating.

Nadège: I don't know what's important about those loom cards. It's a good idea in our line of work to ask as few questions as possible.

Nadège: Good job recovering those cards!

	Nadège: Take this, you've earned it!
	do speaker_give_items(["quest-reward"])
Nadège: There is something weird about the cards. 
- Yeah, I noticed!
	Hero: Up to card no. 87, it's a taffeta weave, then after that it's just a big mess of holes that don't mean anything.
	Nadège: I had underestimated you! You know, if beating monsters up doesn't work out for you, you could always apprentice as a weaver.
- Huh? What do you mean?
	Nadège: Right here, the cards keep lifting all the edge threads. That means there would be nothing left to hold the weft threads. 
Nadège: I will try to find out more about them before we give them back. In the meantime, I have another job for you.
Nadège: François-Emmanuel Verguin, Frank for friends, is a brilliant chemist who's been running a home lab. It turns out that most of his lab is built with supplies that he "borrowed" from his day job at the Vitriolerie chemical plant.
Nadège: It looks like an accountant has decided to put a lot of scrutiny into the Vitriolerie and that is sure to expose what Frank Verguin is doing. Since we strongly believe that Verguin's research is good for Franconia, we want you to go have a chat with Benoît, the accountant.
Nadège: Last we heard, he was on his way to meet with Le Grand Salapou a few blocks West of here, probably to sell him some information. You can easily get there with the side passage just South of the café. You might need the key if the gate is still closed.
Nadège: Do your best to prevent that meeting from happening. Here, take this in case you need to add a little "convincing" to your conversation with Benoît.

Nadège: I talked to a Canut smuggler, he thinks the loom cards you recovered are a coded message. A modified loom would be able to run those and print the decoded message. The problem is we need the cypher cards to decode anything.

Nadège: It was in some silly fairy tale from Rouen. Something about a vampire who got caught because he was collecting paintings.

Nadège: I think it's great that we have so many hills around here. My farouvite baker is down South near the port and my farourite cheese monger is up North, just beyond the city walls.

Nadège: Where I live? That is none of your business!
