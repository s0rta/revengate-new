~ intro
% Tourist: I like the food in Lyon, cheese in particular, but you know, you got to travel North to get proper mustard. How can you call a sandwich a sandwich with what they have here?
% Tourist: You want my advice? Don't schedule a meeting with a Lyonese. They are always late. In Geneva people know how to be on time...
% Tourist: Traboules are awesome to get fast from one place to the other and they keep you shielded form the hot sun. I just can't find the entrances to most of them.
% Tourist: Would you mind not talking so loud. I've got such a bad headache from drinking absinthe yesterday. I think just one of those would have been better than five.
% Tourist: I wanted to try the famous alligator omelette at Brasserie George, but they were sold out. Zut!
